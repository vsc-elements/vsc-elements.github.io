title: React 18 and older
---

In React 18 and earlier, custom elements were not fully supported. Properties and custom events 
had to be added imperatively using the useEffect hook. To simplify this process, a separate package 
was created, providing wrapper components based on the @lit/react package. To integrate these 
wrapper components into your React app, install the package via npm:

```bash
npm i @vscode-elements/react-elements
```

## Using components

Wrapper component names follow the PascalCase convention, derived from the tag names of 
the corresponding web components.

```typescript
import { VscodeSplitLayout } from "@vscode-elements/react-elements";

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <VscodeSplitLayout
        onVscSplitLayoutChange={(event) => {
          console.log(event);
        }}
      ></VscodeSplitLayout>
    </div>
  );
}
```
